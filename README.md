# rust-zmanim
The Zmanim library is an API that can calculate different astronomical times including sunrise and sunset and Jewish *zmanim* or religious times for prayers and other Jewish religious duties.

This project is a port from pinnymz's [python-zmanim project](https://github.com/pinnymz/python-zmanim), which is in turn a port from Eliyahu Hershfeld's [KosherJava project](https://github.com/KosherJava/zmanim).

See the [KosherJava Zmanim site](https://kosherjava.com) for additional information.
